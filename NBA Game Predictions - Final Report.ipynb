    "### Introduction\n",
    "The NBA (National Basketball Association) is an American based men's basketball league that is considered to be the best basketball league in the world. As of the 2016-2017 season, there are 30 teams divided into two conferences (and further divided into six divisions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main objective is to build prediction models for NBA team performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a broad level, we have decided to focus our project on predicting the outcome of a given nba game. On a high level, our approach will involve determining the most important features in determining game outcomes, and then train a supervised machine learning model on these features over many previous games.

    "## Bivariate Analysis\n",
    "Based on our personal intuition and understanding of the NBA, we listed out some of the variables that we wanted to explore with the understanding that these variables could potentially be important factors in determining which team will win a given matchup. For all of the following variables, we explored bivariate scatterplots, graphing the home team's data on the y axis against the away team's data on the x axis. For our plots concerning the home and away win/loss percentage in the previous N games, we choose 8 games for the purpose of these graphs. A more detailed analysis on how we pick N is discussed in a different section.\n",

    "8. Home W/L Percentage as Home Team\n",
    "\n",
    "Running these graphs over multiple seasons and eyeballing the plots gave us similar results. As an example, we display and inspect these graphs for the most recently completed season (2015-16). Each of the points are color coded: games that were won by the home team are blue while lost games are red. Hovering over each point displays the home team, the teams matched up, and an boolean value of whether or not the away team was playing a back to back game (1 for back to back, 0 for not)."

    "## Result\n",
    "The above code ran the hypothesis test comparing win/loss percentages between regular and back to back games across all teams in the league from the 2005 season to the games that have occured in the current (2016-2017) season. As the results show, for our data collected from the 2005 season and on, at an alpha level of 0.05, we see that there is statistically significant evidence to reject the null in favor of the alternative that teams have a worse record on back to back games compared to regular games, for 53% of teams in the league. Thus, we decide that back to back is a significant predictor that should be included in our model. "

    "Its clear that the first two plots show that the standard deviation of games won and average point differentials have wave-like patterns that are only slowly increasing as a whole (looking across the wave patterns). The increasing trend of the standard deviation of the number of games won shows us that there exists a larger spread of games won throughout the league within a season as we move to more current seasons, indicating there are likely larger gaps between good and bad teams in the league. This could possibly be due to the increasing number of teams in the league. Similarly, the increasing trend in average point differential also supports this idea of a larger gap between good and bad teams, as average point differntials are larger in more current seasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "These effects, however, do not seem particularly large, as the total increase for the standard deviation of games won and average point differential are 4 and 0.5, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we do notice a larger effect is in the total games played graph. We see that the number has been increasing from seasons 1940 to 1990, where it starts to level off. Note that the last point on the total number of games played across seasons is lower because it is the current season which is still in progress. Additionally, the years 1989 and 2011 show dips in the plot due to the lockout season, in which the seasons were condensed. This is important when considering the scope of our data in terms of considering which seasons to include. Seasons after 1990 and after are a lot more similar to the number of total games played currently in the NBA, while going back further and further becomes increasingly different in terms of number of games played.
