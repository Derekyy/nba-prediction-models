    "Our main goal is to build prediction models for NBA team performance. As a first step, we will scrape data from `stats.nba.com` and store relevant data in a local `sqlite` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a broad level, we have decided to focus our project on predicting the outcome of a given nba game. On a high level, our approach will involve determining the most important features in determining game outcomes, and then training a supervised machine learning model on these features over many previous games. There should be certain nuances that we should be careful to account for when modeling nba games. One of these is injuries. We need to find some way of determining the effect that an injured player will have on the result of a game.\n",

    "In this deliverable, we will focus on data collection and understanding the data. We have provided snippets of code to demonstrate some of the work we have done. \n",

    "The above graph is especially interesting because it demonstrates that the performance of a player (in this case, Lebron James) in a given game does not necessarily correlate with more wins. For example, on average Lebron gets more rebounds and (slightly) more points in losses. This is likely because in many wins the games might have been blowout games, so then Lebron would have played less. To account for this, we might wish to analyze the distribution of certain stats depending on the final point differential. To find this, we will work on creating a database of game IDs.\n",
